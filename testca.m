theta1= pi/2
theta2 = pi/4

T1 = [cos(theta1), -sin(theta1); sin(theta1), cos(theta1)]

T2 = [cos(theta2), -sin(theta2); sin(theta2), cos(theta2)]


T1xT2= T1*T2

T2xT1 = T2*T1


%For case 1 (same) plot T1(T2) and T2(T1)





%For case 2 (different) plot T1(T2) and T2(T1)
%Your graphs should be the same in case 1 and different in case 2
